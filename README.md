## Usage

Setup (requires node.js):

```bash
> npm install
```

Start tests:

```bash
> npm test
```

Serve up the App (and ctrl-click the URL that appears in the console)

```bash
> npm run dev
```

To format your code, for the assignment specifications:

```bash
npx prettier . --write
```

The configuration for this is set in `.prettierrc.json`. Feel free to change this to your heart's desire, but try to ensure it still fits the assignment guidelines.

If you are using VS Code, you can also install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). This skeleton code is set up to automatically format your code on save. You can disable this in `.vscode/settings.json` by changing `"editor.formatOnSave": true` to `"editor.formatOnSave": false`.
